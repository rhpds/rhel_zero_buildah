title: Creating images with Container Tools [buildah]
description: |
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to build images from scratch or existing base images using **buildah** and other host based tools.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Initializing a working container for image building
  * Using buildah commands to modify a working container
  * Modfiying a working container with standard system tools
  * Creating an application image from a working container

  # Example Usecase:
  Using *podman* with a Containerfile or Dockerfile input is a common way to build containers from base images. However, this lab, Building containers with **buildah**, provides better control over layer creation and image contents.
