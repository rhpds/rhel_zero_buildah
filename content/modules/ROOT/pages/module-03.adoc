More information on managing containers with `+podman+` can be found in
the https://lab.redhat.com/podman-deploy["`Deploying containers with
container tools`"] scenario.

Inspect the images available on the host using `+podman images+`

Note the name matches what was set using `buildah commit`. The `localhost` prepended to the name of the image indicates that the image is stored locally.

`podman` and `buildah` use the same storage locations on the host, which lets us immediately run the image we just built via `podman`.

```bash
podman run -d -p 80:80 el-httpd1

Check the status of the application container using `podman`.

```bash
podman ps
....

Note the ports and command match the metadata set using `buildah config`.

Inspect the image metadata for the application container using `buildah inspect`.

```bash
buildah inspect localhost/el-httpd1 | grep -A 8 rootfs
....

"`rootfs`": \{ "`type`": "`layers`", "`diff_ids`": [
"`sha256:24d85c895b6b870f6b84327a5e31aa567a5d30588de0a0bdd9a669ec5012339c`",
"`sha256:c613b100be1645941fded703dd6037e5aba7c9388fd1fcb37c2f9f73bc438126`",

"`sha256:2aa09f066ed0ce8aad332cbefe237cbe05777f5790bccfdcda439aff5f5f7509`"
] },

....

Look for the `rootfs` section in the JSON output. You will see layers for each of the `buildah` subcommands run.

Run the following curl command to check that the container is serving an index page on port 80.

```bash
curl localhost:80
