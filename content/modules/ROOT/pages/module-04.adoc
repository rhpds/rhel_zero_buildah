Starting from an existing base container isnâ€™t the only option available
to `+buildah+`. `+Buildah+` can create a minimal container image that
contains metadata and a filesystem stub.

To create this style of image use the `+scratch+` special target for
`+buildah from+`.

[source,bash]
----
buildah from scratch
----

working-container

....

Since there's no starting image, the working container will be called `working-container`.

We can start working with the scratch container using tools on the host by mounting the container filesystem on the host using `buildah mount`.

> _NOTE:_ We capture the output of the `buildah` command in the variable *scratchmnt* to make it easier to work with the filesystem path in these exercises.

```bash
scratchmnt=$(buildah mount working-container)
....

[source,bash]
----
echo ${scratchmnt}
----

/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/5199b9cbf441fe93e3629f9d6336fd7008858b9b6e23629a724ccc2f567f3feb/merged

....

Right now, that directory is empty.

```bash
ls -l ${scratchmnt}
....

total 0 ```
